# Sime Game Engine C++

This is a "simple" game engine using Xcode and SFML. My goal was to attempt a rendering
loop using C++. Xcode was my IDE of choice, but Visual Studio would produce similar
effects.

The project:
	- Produces a window.
	- Loads resources.
	- Allows control of a player sprite using WASD keyboard keys.
	- Bounds for the player have been set.
	- Demonstrates a basic game rendering loop

All resources that were needed for the project, such as "player.png" were in the same
directory as the built product (the executable).
